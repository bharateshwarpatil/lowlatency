## Activities

The field of performance includes the following activities, listed in an ideal order of
execution:

1. Setting performance objectives and performance modeling
2. Performance characterization of prototype software or hardware
3. Performance analysis of development code, pre-integration
4. Performing non-regression testing of software builds, pre- or post-release
5. Benchmarking/benchmarketing for software releases
6. Proof-of-concept testing in the target environment
7. Configuration optimization for production deployment
8. Monitoring of running production software
9. Performance analysis of issues

###  CPU Performance 

CPU Performance Counters
 They typically include counters for the following:
 
 CPU cycles: including stall cycles and types of stall cycles

 CPU instructions: retired (executed)

 Level 1, 2, 3 cache accesses: hits, misses

 Floating-point unit: operations

 Memory I/O: reads, writes, stall cycles

 Resource I/O: reads, writes, stall cycle

Since performance counters vary among manufacturers, a standard has been developed to provide a consistent interface across them. This is the Processor Application Programmers Interface (PAPI). Instead of the Intel names seen in
PAPI assigns generic names to the counter types, for example, PAPI_tot_cyc for total cycle counts, instead of CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
